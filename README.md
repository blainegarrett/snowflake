snowflake - Physics and Math modeling suite for Google Cloud Platform
=========

Named after the multidimensional object in Warren Ellis' graphic novel "Planetary", snowflake
is aimed to be an extensive module for mathematical modeling and calculation.

Goals
=========
* Modelling polynomials, discontinuous functions, parametric & multivariable equations
* Modeling atoms and other complex data functions
* GUI and REST api interfaces (Google App Engine)
* Read and Write datasets for complex or long running operations (Google Cloud Storage)
* Visualization and Graphing
* Standardized Function interface for evaluation of single and multivariable equations 
* Full unit test coverage for core functionality

Target Operations
==========
* Simple Math
* Simple Algebra
* Pre-Calculus (matrices, trig)
* Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
* Multivariable Calculus
* Linear Algebra
* Probability

Target Problems
============
* Solving systems of linear equations
* A priori and similar data mining applications
* Permutations of Molecules
* Spline extrapolation
* Node Network Mapping
* Language Processing
